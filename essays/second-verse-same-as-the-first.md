I cannot recall where I first encountered the cliché "There are two ways of doing things: the right way, and again." What I can recall is that I've gotten very good at doing things again. Nearly two decades ago was the first encounter with programming: Introduction to Computing for Engineers at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University at Daytona Beach. For a number of reasons, college didn't work out and I found myself fixing electronics of all kinds for the US Navy. So here I am, doing it again.

## Engineering Physics to Computer Science

At ERAU, I studied Engineering Physics. Many of the classes were enjoyable: Modern Literature, Fluid Dynamics, using the windtunnel in labs. Many of them were loathsome: Electrical Engineering, Calculus II, Electrical Engineering. Of all the courses I sat through, programming was not my favorite. It wasn't even particularly interesting. However, despite not having touched C, C#, or MATLAB in 18 years, I find myself able to recall syntax while sitting in my ICS 212 course. I remember using the basics of troubleshooting in my daily life.

Perhaps most importantly, I find myself wondering how the video games I enjoy playing work, and performing Q&A testing for a variety of games in pre-alpha states. I want to be more literate than a random schmuck on the street when discussing computer problems. I'm not sure what I want to be when I grow up, but I know it's going to use computers and electronics, and a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science (General Track) seems like a solid place to start.

## Finding My Cliché

Software Engineering is a broad skillset, and it is my experience that opportunities favor people with generalized skillsets over specialists: "A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one." Combining my experiences with a broad comprehension of CS as a whole, I hope to find a career path in the future that is both satisfying and intriguing enough to stimulate a desire for higher learning.
