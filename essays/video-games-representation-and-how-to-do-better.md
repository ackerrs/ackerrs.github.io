# Video Games, Representation, and How To Do Better

LGBTQIA+ representation in video games is increasing, and many either consider this to be a positive change or have little to no opinion at all. However, games such as the *Persona* series (*P\#*) and *Mass Effect: Andromeda* (*ME*) and consultation groups such as Sweet Baby Inc. (SBI) have negative impacts on LGBTQIA+ inclusivity and acceptance in video games due to perpetuating demeaning stereotypes, inaccurate character implementation, and poor public relation controls. These game series and company are particularly egregious violators: Role Playing Games (RPGs) encourage players to associate themselves with the Player Characters (PCs), making interactions personal, while SBI is a company that purports championing minority groups and increasing inclusivity and diversity in the gaming industry.  

# A How-To On Stereotypes

Stereotypes are not only an unavoidable part of the human condition, they serve an important role in storytelling. If a character is introduced as male, stereotypes will automatically generate a considerable amount of detail that is not explicitly stated. A character described as flamboyant may wear bright colors, act ostentatiously, or even have a particular tone of voice and behaviors associated with a particular subset of gay men, depending on utilization. These stereotypes are the palette from which a story is painted, however, care needs be taken to avoid using stereotypes problematically. A persistent theme in video games is using homosexual characters only to generate discomfort in players. One example is 2016’s *P5*, when two adult gay men approach the PC. Despite knowing the PC is underage, these men describe how attractive he is and force the player to Shinjuku (Tokyo’s Red Light district) against their will. As Queenie writes, “it hurts like a motherfucker, to think that this is how the writers of this game see people like me, this is how they judge us.” [[6]](#6) This is hardly an isolated incident in the *Persona* series: *Persona 3* has the PC encounter “Beautiful Lady” on the beach, who again sexually approaches underage characters and sends them into a panic when they notice some missed chin stubble. Instead of writing jokes at the expense of ostracized communities, write jokes that highlight positives or the struggles faced. Use LGBTQIA+ characters as more than a quick laugh. When a character is homophobic, write them in such a way as their homophobia is a negative quality from which the character grows out of or suffers repercussions for having.  

## They Said What?

Poor utilization of LGBTQIA+ characters is further exacerbated by poorly written and designed characters themselves. *ME* introduces the player to Scientific Director Hainly Abrams, a trans woman who, shortly after meeting the player, deadnames herself. For anyone familiar at all with the transgender community, sharing their status as a transgender person and deadnaming themselves to a complete stranger ranges from unlikely to unthinkable. In narratives, coding is the act of implying a character’s qualities without explicitly stating them. 2012’s *P4*’s Kanji is a gay/bisexual coded male and Naoto is a trans man coded female. Rather than embracing these codes, however, both characters shoehorn hours of LGBTQIA+ coding into toxic masculinity and workplace gender discrimination. Kanji is even asked later by his friends “‘Are we gonna be safe alone with you?’ suggesting that … if Kanji had been gay, he would also be prone to behave inappropriately” (Petit)[[4]](#4}. For an underrepresented community, the rejection and explicit fear of their members in these RPGs is a slap to the face: after hours of emotionally tying themselves to the PC, those very PCs denigrate the player. As Petrova states, “Studies have shown … such representation has a positive effect on the people inside the community, and games are known to … provide a safe space for LGBT people” (44).[[5]](#5) It is not far reaching to extrapolate LGBTQIA+ individuals being misrepresented, ridiculed, or denied in video games would in turn have deleterious effects. Many of these problems would be resolved through greater LGBTQIA+ diversity in the industry, either directly hired in Quality Assurance teams or contracted to companies such as SBI.  

## Height of Impropriety

Companies that champion inclusion, diversity, and better writing are vital to ensuring accurate and meaningful representation of all communities, not only LGBTQIA+. However, as the vanguard in the controversy that is LGBTQIA+ rights, the actions of these companies and their employees are spotlighted. SBI as a company has been involved in at least 21 games, many of which have sold millions of copies (e.g. *Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla*, *Spider-Man 2*), and has been credited by many of its contractees for excellent work. However, the company was embroiled in controversy when two of its employees began harassing an anti-SBI Steam curator group, going so far as to request doxxing information to get the group’s founder fired. This behavior resulted in tweets from these employees being unearthed that include “@AMarxistDog abort all the Jews,” “i usually get grossed out when straight white rich people kiss but even i think those two are pretty cute,” and “had a nightmare that i was a white male gamer.”[[9]](#9) SBI’s CEO Kim Belair’s blind support for her employees resulted in several of her excellent interviews and speeches being wrongly portrayed by a very vocal minority as anti-gamer, anti-cis gender, and anti-white. Companies must be better in ensuring their employees do not violate ethical behaviors, and swiftly condemning such actions when they occur. These bouts of negative press are often presented to uninvolved parties in a way that harms the very ideals espoused.  

## In Pursuit of Happiness

The video game industry has much to improve in representing the LGBTQIA+ communities, but a few simple actions will dramatically improve the current status. Better understanding of the people in each community through diversified hiring practices and sensitivity readings will result in better stereotyping. Characters that are biased against LGBTQIA+ characters and themes should either grow past their biases, suffer consequences directly related to their antisocial behavior, or be removed entirely. Companies must ensure their employees act ethically at all times, even when interacting with zealous bigots. Through exposing these acts of intolerance and demanding better, the video game industry can fight for a brighter tomorrow.
