_Screenshot of actual website vs Bootstrap 5 mockup made for class._

Like many millennials, MySpace was responsible for introducing me to HTML. For Software Engineering I, it once again makes a debut in the form of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. HTML as a concept, however, has existed since 1989 and was "released" as HTML 1.0 in 1993. In the following 32 years, the marketshare has grown such that 97.8%[[1]](#1) of websites use HTML5, when the markup language is known.

## Spiders Make the Best Web Designers

Any software engineer who intends to work in a field that requires web development will want to understand the basics of HTML at a minimum. ICS 314 tosses students into a whirlwind introduction of HTML, then CSS, and finally Bootstrap 5 for understanding User Interface (UI) basics. The languages themselves are simple and forgiving to many errors any "coding" language would fail to compile for, yet they has proven to be frustrating and difficult to incorporate.

## A Failure to Communicate

Attempting to separate Bootstrap 5 from HTML and CSS is like trying to separate Typescript from Javascript. Yes, there are technical differences but the first _is_ the second. Using Bootstrap provides a standardized way to call HTML constructs without needing to define each and every detail of each and every <div>. In many ways, Bootstrap expedites development by shortening code and simplifying the concepts. In others, Bootstrap confounds efforts to deviate from those standardizations and has not yet proven intuitive in overriding.

Furthermore, the forgiving nature of HTML has been a repeated blight. Deleting the incorrect number of </div>s might result in the entire page becoming a single column or the entire page turning black. This is because failing to close a wrap does not fail to compile, it simply continues to apply that format until the document ends. HTML also suffers from a lack of capability, and relies on CSS and Javascript to fill in the gaps. Without the ability to execute logic, run calculations, or communicate with other devices, developers will need more tools in their pocket for anything complex.

## A Conclusion Negated

Despite the issues with HTML, its ease of access and broad integration mean any devices that want to reliably function online _will_ be compatible with the language. As a CS major, any tool that is widely used is a good tool to have at least a passing familiarity. Given the simplification offered by Bootstrap and the finesse offered by CSS, both raw HTML and Bootstrap will find a place with me.
