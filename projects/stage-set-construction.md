Diamond Head Theatre and PalikÅ« Theatre are stages frequently utilized by community theatre groups, for shows such as *Grease*, *Man of La Mancha*, *The Spongebob Musical*, *Gypsy*, and *Come From Away*. These shows are typically understaffed and underfunded, so when a friend reached out to request assistance I was happy to volunteer.

My responsibilities primarily consisted of woodwork, power tool usage, painting, and generalized heavy lifting duties during the weeks leading up to these shows. The set designer would outline the concepts and give what details were required, and I was largely left to implement the instructions on my own.

Assisting with these plays was a great exercise in spacial intelligence, communication, design, drafting, woodworking, rigging, and safety. In addition to developing and reinforcing these skill sets, the work and getting to see my creations on stage was extremely rewarding.
